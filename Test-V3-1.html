<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<ul>
<li>The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,<br>
of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.</li>
<li>There are no other obstructions on the table surface.</li>
<li>The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be<br>
prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the<br>
robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid<br>
movement commands must still be allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create an application that can read in commands of the following (textual) form:</p>
<pre><code>PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH,<br>
SOUTH, EAST or WEST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any<br>
sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE<br>
command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until<br>
a valid PLACE command has been executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is<br>
currently facing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction<br>
without changing the position of the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form,<br>
but standard output is sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT<br>
and REPORT commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide test data to exercise the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application must be a command line application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also<br>
includes the initial placement of the toy robot.</li>
<li>Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The problem must be solved using any language familiar to you. NodeJS &amp; Java are preferred.</p>
<p>All solutions must be delivered in git repository form. Github and bitbucket links are preferred.</p>
<p>Your solution must have a readme file with detailed insuructions to install, run &amp; test the apllication.</p>
<p>Please provide your source code, and any test code/data you using in<br>
developing your solution.</p>
<p>Please engineer your solution to a standard you consider suitable for<br>
production. It is not required to provide any graphical output showing the<br>
movement of the toy robot.</p>
